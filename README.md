# Tokenless

**Private, Compliant Asset Tokenization on Midnight ‚Äî No Public Tokens, Full Privacy**

---

## üìå Overview

Tokenless is a natively Midnight-based asset tokenization system. It enables secure, verifiable, and private representation of investments and participations on-chain‚Äîwithout issuing public or transferable tokens. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) guarantee user privacy and regulatory compliance, preventing public exposure of balances, identities, or investment patterns.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **No public tokens:** No transferable tokens or public balance lists.
- **Privacy by design:** All actions (investment, project creation, withdrawals) are protected by ZKPs.
- **Regulatory compliance:** Supports zk-credentials for KYC, AML, and residency without exposing sensitive data.
- **On-chain verifiability:** All investments and actions are cryptographically auditable and provable.
- **Modular architecture:** Decoupled smart contracts, API, and UI, with privacy logic at every layer.
- **Censorship resistance:** No central points of control or participant exposure.
- **Refunds and flexible management:** Integrated refund mechanisms and project administration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/luislucena16/tokenless.git
cd tokenless
```

### 2. Verify Node.js version

```sh
node -v
# Must be >= 22
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

### 4. Build all packages

```sh
yarn build:all
```
> _This command builds all workspaces: `packages/contract`, `packages/api`, `packages/cli`, and `packages/ui`._

### 3. Download and Prepare ZK Parameters (Required for Proofs)

After building, you need to fetch the zero-knowledge (ZK) parameters required by the proof server. This is done via a helper script that you should place in the CLI package:

```bash
# Move to the CLI package directory
cd packages/cli

# Download the fetch-zk-params.sh script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricktowers/midnight-proof-server/main/fetch-zk-params.sh
# or
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricktowers/midnight-proof-server/main/fetch-zk-params.sh

# Give execution permissions
chmod +x fetch-zk-params.sh

# Run the script to download ZK parameters
./fetch-zk-params.sh
```

> **Note:**
> - This script will generate a folder at `/.cache/midnight/zk-params` with all the required parameters for zero-knowledge proofs.
> - **Why is this needed?** If you see an error like:
>   `Error in response: Proving(public parameters for k=16 not found in cache)`
>   it means the required parameters are missing.
> - **This script is a workaround** to ensure your application works locally. The Midnight team is working on a more integrated solution for parameter management in the future.

### 6. Launch Midnight infrastructure (TestNet)

```sh
docker compose -f testnet.yml up -d
```
> _The `-d` flag runs containers in the background. You should see output like:_
> ```
>  ‚úî Container tokenless-node          Started
>  ‚úî Container tokenless-proof-server  Started
>  ‚úî Container tokenless-indexer       Started
> ```

### 7. Configure and launch the UI

#### 7.1 Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in `packages/ui` with:

```
VITE_NETWORK_ID=TestNet
VITE_LOGGING_LEVEL=trace
```

#### 7.2 Build and start

```sh
npx turbo run build
yarn start
```

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## üí° How It Works

1. **User connects their wallet** (Lace Midnight-compatible).
2. **Frontend initializes providers** and connects to the contract (deploy or join).
3. **Investments and actions** are performed using zero-knowledge proofs, never exposing sensitive data.
4. **Contract state** (projects, balances, etc.) is queried and updated in real time using observables.
5. **The UI never accesses or displays private data:** everything is managed via ZKPs and controlled access logic.

---

## üîí Privacy & Compliance

- **ZKPs for every interaction:** All operations require zero-knowledge proofs.
- **No public balances:** No transferable tokens or investor lists.
- **Demonstrable compliance:** Users can invest and withdraw without disclosing their data.
- **No pattern exposure:** Neither amount nor frequency of investment is public.

## üß™ Development Commands

- **Install dependencies:** `yarn install`
- **Build all:** `yarn build:all`
- **Download ZK params (one-liner):**
  ```sh
  cd packages/cli && \
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricktowers/midnight-proof-server/main/fetch-zk-params.sh && \
  chmod +x fetch-zk-params.sh && \
  ./fetch-zk-params.sh
  ```
- **Launch infrastructure:** `docker compose -f testnet.yml up -d`
- **Build UI:** `npx turbo run build`
- **Start UI:** `yarn start`
