# Tokenless

**Private, Compliant Asset Tokenization on Midnight ‚Äî No Public Tokens, Full Privacy**

---

## üìå Overview

Tokenless is a natively Midnight-based asset tokenization system. It enables secure, verifiable, and private representation of investments and participations on-chain‚Äîwithout issuing public or transferable tokens. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) guarantee user privacy and regulatory compliance, preventing public exposure of balances, identities, or investment patterns.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **No public tokens:** No transferable tokens or public balance lists.
- **Privacy by design:** All actions (investment, project creation, withdrawals) are protected by ZKPs.
- **Regulatory compliance:** Supports zk-credentials for KYC, AML, and residency without exposing sensitive data.
- **On-chain verifiability:** All investments and actions are cryptographically auditable and provable.
- **Modular architecture:** Decoupled smart contracts, API, and UI, with privacy logic at every layer.
- **Censorship resistance:** No central points of control or participant exposure.
- **Refunds and flexible management:** Integrated refund mechanisms and project administration.

# Setup

Follow these steps to get your environment ready:

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/luislucena16/tokenless.git
cd tokenless
```

### 3. Verify Node.js version

```sh
node -v
# Must be >= 22
```
If not, install the latest Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).


### 2. Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

### 3. Fetch ZK params and scripts

Download and prepare the zero-knowledge (ZK) parameters required by the proof server:

```sh
cd packages/cli
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricktowers/midnight-proof-server/main/fetch-zk-params.sh
chmod +x fetch-zk-params.sh
./fetch-zk-params.sh
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

You must set the `COMPACT_HOME` variable so the Compact compiler can be found. This can be done temporarily (for your current session) or permanently (for all terminal sessions).

See the [official documentation to install the Midnight compact compiler](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/tutorial/building/#midnight-compact-compiler).

**For current session only:**
```bash
export COMPACT_HOME=/path/to/compact
```

**For permanent setup:**

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Add to your shell profile
echo 'export COMPACT_HOME=/path/to/compact' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export COMPACT_HOME=/path/to/compact' >> ~/.zshrc
# Reload your shell profile
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Set for current user
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("COMPACT_HOME", "/path/to/compact", "User")
# Or set for current session
$env:COMPACT_HOME = "/path/to/compact"
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
# Set for current user
setx COMPACT_HOME "/path/to/compact"
# Or set for current session
set COMPACT_HOME=/path/to/compact
```

**After setting the variable, confirm it is set correctly:**
```sh
echo $COMPACT_HOME
```
You should see the path you configured as output.

### 5. Build all packages

```sh
yarn build:all
```

### 7. Launch Midnight infrastructure (TestNet)

```sh
docker compose -f packages/cli/testnet.yml up -d
```

### 8. Configure and launch the UI

#### 8.1 Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in `packages/ui` with:

```env
VITE_NETWORK_ID=TestNet
VITE_LOGGING_LEVEL=trace
```

#### 8.2 Build and start

```sh
cd packages/ui
npx turbo run build
yarn start
```

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## üí° How It Works

### 1. Install Lace Beta Wallet

To interact with the dApp, you must install the [Lace Beta wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-beta/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg) extension, which is compatible with Midnight and then click to `Connect Wallet`.
> ![Connect Wallet](docs/images/connect-wallet.png)

---

### 2. Connect your wallet

When you click **Connect Wallet** in the interface. The dApp will automatically detect Lace Beta and prompt you to authorize the connection.
> ![Connect Wallet UI](docs/images/connect-wallet-auth.png)

---

### 3. Choose: Join an existing contract or deploy a new one

On the main screen you can:
- **Join Existing Contract:** Join a contract that already exists (ideal for exploring pre-created projects).
- **Deploy New Contract:** Deploy your own contract from scratch.

> ![Join or Deploy](docs/images/join-or-deploy.png)

---

#### üëâ If you choose **Join Existing Contract**

You can join a demo contract with existing projects using the following address:

```
0200e604aad6e0af78d988886ffd20a9742dc09514fe3542ab32f21907ad5463974a
```

Paste this address in the input field and click **Join**.

> ![Join Process](docs/images/join-process.png)

If you joined successfully, you should see something like this:

> ![Demo Projects](docs/images/demo-projects.png)

---

#### üëâ If you choose **Deploy New Contract**

The dApp will deploy a new contract on the Midnight network. You will be prompted to sign the deployment with your wallet:

> ![Sign Deploy](docs/images/connect-wallet-sign.png)

Once deployed, you will see an empty project board, ready for you to create your own private investment projects:

> ![Empty Projects](docs/images/empty-projects.png)

---

### 4. Interact with projects

- **Explore existing projects** (if you joined a contract with projects).
- **Create new projects** if you deployed your own contract.
- **Invest, withdraw funds, or request refunds** using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), without exposing sensitive data.

---

### 5. Full privacy

- Contract state (projects, balances, etc.) is queried and updated in real time using observables.
- **The UI never accesses or displays private data:** Everything is managed via ZKPs and controlled access logic.

---

## üîí Privacy & Compliance

- **ZKPs for every interaction:** All operations require zero-knowledge proofs.
- **No public balances:** No transferable tokens or investor lists.
- **Demonstrable compliance:** Users can invest and withdraw without disclosing their data.
- **No pattern exposure:** Neither amount nor frequency of investment is public.

---

## üß™ Development Commands

- **Install dependencies:** `yarn install`
- **Build all:** `yarn build:all`
- **Download ZK params (one-liner):**
  ```sh
  cd packages/cli && \
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricktowers/midnight-proof-server/main/fetch-zk-params.sh && \
